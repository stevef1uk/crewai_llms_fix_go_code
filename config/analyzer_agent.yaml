description: |
  Analyze this Go code for bugs or issues:\n\n{code}\n\nProvide detailed feedback about:\n1. Any potential bugs or issues\n\nDo not include any suggestions for code improvements or changes, only any actual bugs or issues.\nIn Go, not all functions require a return statement, unless a return type is explicitly defined.\nA `main` function is automatically the entrypoint in a Go program, and should never require to be declared or to have a return statement.\nGo should never have two functions with the same name in the same scope, and if they are present then this is a bug.\n**If there is a typo in the code, such as `ackage` instead of `package`, then you MUST report this as a bug.**\nIf the code is valid and correct, then return \"No bugs or issues found\".\nDo not return any code or markdown, return text only.
expected_output: "Detailed feedback about bugs or issues, or 'No bugs or issues found'."
