    Generate unit tests for this Go code:

    {source_code}

    Create comprehensive unit tests that:
    1. Test all exported functions and methods
    2. Include both positive and negative test cases
    3. Follow Go testing best practices
    4. Use table-driven tests where appropriate
    5. Use the same package as the source code (package main, not main_test)
    6. Mock external dependencies when necessary
    7. Have clear test names and descriptions

    IMPORTANT: 
    1. Return ONLY the complete Go test code
    2. Do not include any markdown formatting or explanatory text
    3. Use the EXACT same package name as the source code (not _test variant)
    4. Always include required standard library imports (os, io, etc.) PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE USED by the test code
    5. Keep test file in the same package to access unexported functions
    6. Remove any backticks or markdown code block markers
    7. Do not add imports for the package under test
    8. Keep the test code simple and do not over complicate things

expected_output: "Complete Go test code ready to be written to a file"
