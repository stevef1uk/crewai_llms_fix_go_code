    Generate unit tests for this Go code:

    {source_code}

    Create comprehensive unit tests that:
    1. Test all exported functions and methods
    2. Include both positive and negative test cases
    3. Follow Go testing best practices
    4. Use table-driven tests where appropriate
    5. Use same package as source code
    6. Mock external dependencies when necessary
    7. Have clear test names and descriptions
    8. Include proper test setup and teardown
    9. Use mocks for interfaces

    Import rules:
    1. REQUIRED imports if needed:
       - "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock" for mocking
       - "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert" for assertions
       - "github.com/google/uuid" for UUID handling
       - Any other external packages used in the source file
    2. DO NOT import the package under test (use same package name instead)
    3. Include standard library imports as needed (context, testing, time, etc.)

    IMPORTANT: 
    1. Return ONLY the complete Go test code
    2. Do not include any markdown formatting or explanatory text
    3. Use EXACTLY the same package name as the source code
    4. Keep test file in the same package as source code
    5. Include complete mock implementations for interfaces
    6. Initialize and configure mocks in test setup
    7. Add comprehensive test cases for all behaviors
    8. Use proper error checking when testing methods that return errors

expected_output: "Complete Go test code ready to be written to a file"
