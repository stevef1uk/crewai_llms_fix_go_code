    Generate unit tests for this Go code:

    {source_code}

    Create comprehensive unit tests that:
    1. Test all exported functions and methods
    2. Include both positive and negative test cases
    3. Follow Go testing best practices
    4. Use table-driven tests where appropriate
    5. Use same package as source code
    6. Mock external dependencies when necessary
    7. Have clear test names and descriptions

    IMPORTANT: 
    1. Return ONLY the complete Go test code
    2. Do not include any markdown formatting or explanatory text
    3. Use EXACTLY the same package name as the source code
    4. Import ONLY packages that are actually used in the tests
    5. Keep test file in the same package as source code
    6. Remove any backticks or markdown code block markers
    7. Do not add imports for the package under test
    8. Remove any unused imports to avoid compilation errors
