Example code to use CrewAI with an LLM to fix python code

I suggest a python venv is used to run this code.

You will need to create a .env file containing the keys needed for the two Foundations LLMs supported:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY

The example directory has 3 example configuration files to show this running against 3 differnet types of Go projects:

example_simple
example_server
example_modules

You can run all of them with: 

python  main_fix_only.py examples/config_simple.yaml

python  main_fix_only.py examples/config_server.yaml

python  main_fix_only.py examples/config_modules.yaml

The initial Go code should be ok so the LLMs won't be called. Edit the code that has been configured to be repaired and see what happens.

A backup of the source file is kept in case it is corrupted as LLMs sometimes have minds of their own.
