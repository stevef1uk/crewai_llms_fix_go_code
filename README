There are two programs in this repository:

1. main_fix_only/py - a program to fix and enhance the configured go source modue
2. main_test_gen.py - a program to generate unit tests for the congigures source file.

Both are really example code to use CrewAI with an LLM to fix / enhance a Go source code file.
99% of this code has been generated by Gemini, CLaude LLMs with 1% by me.

I suggest a python venv is used to run this code. Then run pip istall -r requirements.txt

You will need to create a .env file containing the keys needed for the two Foundations LLMs supported (if you want to use these):

GOOGLE_API_KEY="<your key>"
OPENAI_API_KEY="<your key>"

The example directory has 3 example configuration files to show this running against 3 differnet types of Go projects:

example_simple
example_server
example_modules

You can run all of them with: 

python  main_fix_only.py examples/config_simple.yaml

python  main_fix_only.py examples/config_server.yaml

python  main_fix_only.py examples/config_modules.yaml

To use Ollama which can run locally installed models, such as deepspeed:r1 use:
python main_fix_only.py --llm ollama --ollama-host http://127.0.0.1:11434 --ollama-model deepseek-r1 examples/config_simple.yaml

To use OpenAI use:
python main_fix_only.py --llm openai --openai-model gpt-3.5-turbo examples/config_simple.yaml


The initial Go code should be ok so the LLMs won't be called. Edit the code that has been configured to be repaired and see what happens.

A backup of the source file is kept in case it is corrupted as LLMs sometimes have minds of their own.

The test code genaerator is run in a very similar madder with the same LLM options supported, however, only OpenAI seems to be able
to reasonably reliably generate working unit tests. Gemini may take  few attempts and Ollama failed to complete the task on my set-up.

python main_test_gen.py -v ./examples/config_simple.yaml --llm openai --openai-model gpt-3.5-turbo

It sometimes take the LLMs a while to process this so please be patient.

NO WARRENTY or FIT FOR PURPOSE Claims are being made. Use at your own risk!

Roadmap: To automatically generate unit tests for the Go source file
